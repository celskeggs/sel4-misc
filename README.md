# selkie

selkie is a WIP OS personality for the seL4 microkernel, written almost entirely from scratch.

# Current Status

A significant portion of selkie's existing code works, but the code is likely to fail due to errors in the new components that are currently being tested.

# Building

You will need to set up submodules before you can build selkie.

To build and run, type

    $ ./build.sh

Type Ctrl-A x to exit qemu.

# License

See LICENSE.txt for licensing info. A summary: the upstream code is under the 2-Clause BSD License, and the selkie-specific code is under the MIT License.
