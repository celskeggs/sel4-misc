brief architecture overview:

---- privileged servers ----
root server: controls servers and manages memory. communicates only with sandbox server.
sandbox server: controls i/o overview between processes. all processes start only with an endpoint for this server.
                relays connection requests between servers and relays memory and process creation requests to root server.
---- system servers ----
registrar server(s): root or branch nodes in registration trees
monitor server(s): contain device drivers to talk to user via serial, text-mode VGA, graphics, etc. contain multiplexing code to let user control monitor inputs to servers.
bus server(s): contain device drivers for interconnects (shared interrupt lines, PCI, USB).
disk server(s): contain device drivers to talk to disks.
filesystem server(s): contain filesystem handling code.
storage server: interconnect between filesystem servers and individual applications.
network card server(s): contain device drivers to talk to network cards.
network server: IP routing, firewalls, and isolation.
sound card server(s): contain device drivers to talk to sound cards.
sound server: sound mixing and routing.
power server: contains device drivers for ACPI, etc. and manages system power state.
installation server: capable of installing programs. checks signatures, etc.
---- core applications ----
storage management app: file transfer handling.
process app: monitor and control running servers.
policy app: configure and reconfigure policies.
powerbox app: transiently permit specific privileges.
power app: interface for controlling shutdown, sleep, hibernate, etc. also laptop batteries, charging, etc.
launcher app: launch other applications
installation app: has permission to install programs.


note that individual servers are very much allowed to create their own sub-TCBs! only top-level process creation is handled like this.
